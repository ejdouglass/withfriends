    Brainstorming... so, can I set up 'subscriptions' to, say, the room, the area, etc.?
    A HAX to imitate this behavior could be setting up a STRINGIFIED version of the room/etc.
        ... then have an interval'd "ping" comparing the current state of the room to the current (or timestamps of last known update)
        ... if different, trigger an emit for the user
    
    Ok! Further research shows that socket.io has 'rooms' and 'namespaces,' as well as socket IDs we can emit to specifically.
    NEATO.

    Ah! So we're looking at something like
    io.of('namespaceX').on('connection', (socket) => {}) ... for namespaces.

    Each NAMESPACE is kind of like a sub-server, I guess? It has its own event handlers and 'rooms' and 'middlewares'.

    As you'd expect, you can also do stuff like const usersNamespace = io.of('/users');

    io.on('connection', (socket) => {
