// Spitballing on 'final' areas prototype for beta
/*
    Rooms/areas might (or, likely, WILL) get changed; the SAFEST way to save them to characters is just the coords, which should remain absoulute;
    -- area names can change (case in point, I don't want to call it "tutorialGeneric" above anymore :P)
    -- so, areaKey should be an ID, not a name; roomKey could be RPS+GPS (or just GPS, if RPS is already accounted for)
    -- how can I refactor so we can always 'find' where characters should be based on where they saved?
        -> can introduce 'conditional loading' where, if we can't find where they're supposed to be, we make a 'best guess'
        -> if 'best guess' doesn't come up with something, then just plop them at a hardcoded fallback spawn :P
    
    Still a big HMMM: the RPS+GPS concept. 

    Some ideas:
    -) Store a 'reference atlas' that charGPS is referenced against while loading, 'zooming in' layer by layer to plop you back to the right spot
    -) Have different RPS be the 'root' keys in Areas, then have MAP level, then ZONE/MUD level

    So we have (REALITY) --> MAP --> ZONE --> SECTION --> ROOM. That work?
    ... I keep having 'bigger ideas' but that would delay this project by a TON to implement. SCALE BACK BRO. VERSION ZERO. ZE-RO. 
    TECH DEMO. Please now. Bring it back. :P
    ... you can consider having a different way to 'render' the raw data later. That's fine! 
    Ok, now that we've got that out of the way...

    What are we solving here?
    -- I want to just save the character's "POSITION" as a simple RPS+GPS, since that's being designed to be absolute.
    -- Set the data so that it's fairly trivial to re-load from just that RPS+GPS.

/*
    Brainstorming... so, can I set up 'subscriptions' to, say, the room, the area, etc.?
    A HAX to imitate this behavior could be setting up a STRINGIFIED version of the room/etc.
        ... then have an interval'd "ping" comparing the current state of the room to the current (or timestamps of last known update)
        ... if different, trigger an emit for the user
    
    Ok! Further research shows that socket.io has 'rooms' and 'namespaces,' as well as socket IDs we can emit to specifically.
    NEATO.

    Ah! So we're looking at something like
    io.of('namespaceX').on('connection', (socket) => {}) ... for namespaces.

    Each NAMESPACE is kind of like a sub-server, I guess? It has its own event handlers and 'rooms' and 'middlewares'.

    As you'd expect, you can also do stuff like const usersNamespace = io.of('/users');

    Ok, here we go! Rooms! "An arbitrary channel that sockets can JOIN and LEAVE." JOINING ROOMS:
    io.on('connection', (socket) => {
        socket.join('room1');
        io.to('room1').emit('Hullo there!'); // Would socket.to('room1') also work? Hm.
    })

    Ok! Rooms are SERVER-ONLY -- the client has no idea what room(s) it is a part of, which is... fine?

    Anyway, you do a socket.join('some room'), then io.to('some room').emit() OR io.in('some room').emit() (interchangeabble to/in)

    Also, io.to('room1').to('area3').emit() works, and if the recipient is in BOTH, they'll only get it once. Huzzah! Smart.

    Note you can also do socket.to('some room'), broadcasting from the given socket rather than a namespace. Either-or. Neat.

    Now the FINAL PIECES for INTERACTION!
    -- ensure each room has its own unique identifier (absolute plus relative coords?)
    -- same for area, though just having a unique KEY should be fine in this case, a la 'lilMap'
